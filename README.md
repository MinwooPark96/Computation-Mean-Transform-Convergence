**Paper Abstraction**

For the polar decomposition $T = U |T | ∈ L(H)$ (defined below), the mean
transform$ T$ of $T$ is defined by
$\hat{T} = \frac{1}{2}(T + |T |U ).$
We prove that the iterated mean transform of a 2 × 2 matrix converges
a normal matrix. Moreover, we provide the computation method of the
iterated mean transforms with an Algorithm in Python.
