**Paper Abstraction**

In this paper, we consider the computation of the Aluthge, Duggal, and Mean transforms of n × n matrices using the singular valued decomposition. We provide examples to illustrate the superiority of our technique in finding iterated Aluthge transform of a matrix over the more traditional methods. From the observations using Python, we know that the iterated Aluthge and Mean transforms of the matrices become normal. However, the iterated Duggal transform of the matrices may not be normal.
